<br>To: Leicester Carpet Cleaners<br>Really friendly guys! Came round first thing and were finished quickly and precisely. The carpets in my front room and lobby had been heavily soiled and had strong pet odors coming from it, which was embarrassing and inconveniencing for me as a tenant. 
<p>
As soon as they had finished the job the smell was gone and had been replaced with a lovely citrus smell. The carpet looks brand new and there's no visible stains left. The price was excellent value for money as they put a lot of hard physical work into the process and had to remove my sofa, bookcase, coffee table and dining table out of the property into the forecourt, and then back again. Genuinely hard working guys who were a pleasure to have round, very highly recommended!

<br>Hello,<br>Helen and I just wanted to drop you a quick line to say thank you for the awesome work Floorfixer have carried out over the last couple of days. Our floors look amazing!
<p>
Rob and Jordan are a credit to your company - they were hard working, efficient, polite and explained everything in detail when asked. A pleasure to have around our home. Please pass on our thanks.
<p>
This morning we woke up to lovely new floors and until we put the furniture back, the kids are using the new front room floor as a temporary dance floor - socks only:)

<p><br> Dear Rob at Cleanpave<br> Thank you very much for your quick response and the excellent service you provided when cleaning our Driveway and Patio with your powerful pressure jet-wash rotary cleaning system. 
<p>
I managed to apply the kiln-dried sand and sealer you provided afterwards, and the area dried quickly ready for us to enjoy again. This small DIY job was as easy as you explained and saved us some money too - which was a definite bonus to me at my age. 
<p>
We would recommend you to everyone we know and will be requesting your service again in the future.

<p> From: Mr &amp; Mrs Williams (Melton Mowbray)</p>
