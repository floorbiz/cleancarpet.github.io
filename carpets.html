<div title="main content" class="cushycms" id="untitled-region-5"><p><strong>The Steam Cleaning Specialists</strong>
<br>
Most carpet manufacturers agree that Steam Cleaning with a hot water extraction system is the most efficient method for removing dirt deep down inside your carpet. The efficiency of the process is aided by using boiling hot water in our powerful hot water extraction machine. It forces a steamspray into the carpet under high pressure, before immediately sucking it back into the unit again together with soiling from the carpet. The steam penetrates into the base of the fibres and releases stubborn dirt which may be trapped within the fibres of the carpet pile.
</p>
Steam cleaning is also considered to be the healthiest way of having your carpet cleaned, because the high water temperature destroys bacteria, fungus, mold and dust mites. <strong>'DRY' carpet-cleaning</strong> may leave detergent residues which can subsequently <u>attract dirt</u><strong>!!</strong>
</p>
Many people have told us that they have ended up paying more to our franchised competitors. Obviously someone has to pay for their expensive advertising campaigns, and this expense is passed down to their customers. As we are an independently run business, we are free to use whatever system or products we consider suitable and not any insisted on by a franchise company.
</p>
<strong><i>"A very efficient and professional service"</i></strong> is how most satisfied customers describe us and they are happy to recommend us to their friends and neighbours. Carpets and furniture can wear and stain over the years, they can be made from many different types of fabrics such as natural man-made fibres - even wool and cotton, but there's no need for you to worry about them being ruined.  The products we use are safe for people and pets and are expertly applied.  We don't use soaps, detergents or harsh chemicals to get a deep cleaning result, and our professional equipment is designed to use a cleaning solution which has a powerful reaction that deep-cleans carpets in a safe and gentle way using natural ingredients.
</p>
